<h1>Food Waste Management</h1>

Food wastage is a prevalent issue in our society, and it is important to effectively address it for the sake of our environment and economy. Managing food waste is crucial as it can contribute to enhancing our sustainability. To tackle this issue, we have recognized the potential of utilizing web technology. Our proposed solution involves creating a Django Python application that enables individuals to donate and share their excess food with those who are in need.


<h2>Features</h2>
1.	Donor Registration: The donor needs to Register himself in the application.<br>
2.	Donor Model: A donor can donate food by signing the application.<br>
3.	Assign Model: Admin can assign the agents to donors for collecting the food.<br>
4.	Complaint, Suggestions, and Rating Model: The donor can give their feedback.<br>
5.	Add, View, Edit, and Delete Agent Model: Admins can perform the tasks as per the requirements.<br>
